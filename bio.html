  <p> Grew up in the very southern part of Maldives. 
  Even as a kid I was always interested in breaking things down to little peices, and then putting them back together.
  It started off with my motherâ€™s watch (remember that day very clearly because I got scolded at for three hours) and then to radios, phones and anything electronic I could get my hands on.
