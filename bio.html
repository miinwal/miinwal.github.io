<div class="paras">
<p> 
	 Hello there! My name is Ahmed Minwal. 
     Just like most IT people I also enjoy breaking things down, and you know, fixing them back together (which is not always the case). 
     Growing up, I used to break down things down. It started with my mom’s watch (remember that clearly because I got scolded for three hours straight) and then moved to TV, Radios and anything that I could get my hands on, like my brother’s toys. 
</p>
	<p>
		If you ask any of my friends they'll tell you that i'm spontaneous, adventerous, very good with people, and that you'll never see me without a smile on my face.
	</p>
<p>
	I've always been interested in Computers and tech stuff, but things really took a toll for me when i was doing my O'levels. I took Computer Studies as one of my subjects and that's what really got me interested in this field. 
	After that i always looked up the latest inventions and anything that's recent in the IT industry.
	</p>
	
<p>
	I am a full time student studying Computing at Edulink International Campus - Sri Lanka, which is affiliated with the University of Nothampton.
	</p>
	<p> 
	If i'm not coding i like to read just about anything. From facts about computers to "how to talk to a giraffe". 
	That is something that i actually did, so if you need to talk to some giraffes i'm your guy. 
	I enjoy a good Novel from time to time.
	</p>
