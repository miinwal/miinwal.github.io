	 Hello there! My name is Ahmed Minwal. 
     Just like most IT people I also enjoy breaking things down, and you know, fixing them back together (which is not always the case). 
     Growing up, I used to break down things down. It started with my mom’s watch (remember that clearly because I got scolded for three hours straight) and then moved to TV, Radios and anything that I could get my hands on, like my brother’s toys.
