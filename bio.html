<p> 
	 Hello there! My name is Ahmed Minwal. 
     Just like most IT people I also enjoy breaking things down, and you know, fixing them back together (which is not always the case). 
     Growing up, I used to break down things down. It started with my mom’s watch 
	(remember that clearly because I got scolded for three hours straight) and then moved to TV, 
	Radios and anything that I could get my hands on, like my brother’s toys. 
</p>
<p>I am currently a student at the University of Northampton. I am doing my bachelors of Science degree in computing (first year). </p>
<p>If you ask any of my friends they’ll tell you that I’m spontaneous, adventurous, and get along with almost everyone. I like travelling to different 
	countries and getting to know new people. . I love the sea and swimming is one of my many and healthy habit.  </p>
<p>In my free time I like to read anything and everything. I don’t stick to one genre.
	I believe that you shouldn’t limit your 
	knowledge to just one particular field. </p>
